## What is it?
This is a utility with a set of tests to explore and compare different ways of detecting ‘memory pressure’ (the system is running out of free memory) state in Linux kernel-based OS.

It consists of a few sub-components, that collect and analyze various metrics:

### /proc/meminfo observer
This reads and parses ```/proc/meminfo``` file and generates the following metrics:

```mem_total``` - total system physical memory (in megabytes)

```mem_avail_est``` -  the amount of memory that is available for a new workload, without pushing the system into swap, estimated from `MemFree`, `Active(file)`, `Inactive(file)`, and `SReclaimable`, as well as the "low" watermarks from `/proc/zoneinfo` file. This is counted using a legacy algorithm from Linux kernel, see https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=34e431b0a patch description and code comments for the details and explanations.

```mem_avail``` - the amount of memory that is available for a new workload, without pushing the system into swap, ```'MemAvailable'``` param from ```/proc/meminfo``` file. Current Linux kernel versions count this in a slightly different way than in a previous metric.

```mem_pcnt``` - percent of physical memory filling. This can be used for "simple" memory pressure threshold-based evaluation.

```swp_pcnt``` - percent of swap usage

```swp_free``` - free swap space (in megabytes)

```swp_total``` - total swap spaces  (in megabytes)

Optional metrics:

```mem_reclaim``` - Part of Slab, that might be reclaimed, such as caches (in megabytes)

```mem_inactive``` - The total amount of buffer or page cache memory, that are free and and available (in megabytes)

To enable optional metrics, you can add a custom option to the command line like ```-showInactive -showReclaimable```


### Page faults counter
One task of this observer is to monitor ```'pgmajfault'``` (page faults counter) parameter. In case if current faults per second value is significantly higher than the average, we can assume that swap trashing is happening. Because sample times are inconsistent and we're measuring CPU time instead of real time, EWMA low-pass filter is applied for the values. 

Metrics:
```swp_flts_sec``` - page faults per second

```swp_flts_sec_f``` - page faults per second with EWMA low-pass filter

```swp_flts_mult```- current page faults per second and average page faults per second ratio. This can be used for swap trashing evaluation.

Custom options:

```lowPassHalfLifeSeconds``` - low-pass filter half-life time (in seconds), default is 30.

```averageOnlyCurrent``` - don't calculate average pages faults using statics collected by the OS before the program was started, use only new values (default: false).

Example: ```-lowPassHalfLifeSeconds=15 -averageOnlyCurrent```

### 'Swap tendency' calculator

Another task is to count 'swap tendency' metric, as it is described here https://access.redhat.com/solutions/103833

The actual problem is that 'swappines' is a standard system param, 'mapped ratio' can be counted from 'nr_mapped' system metric, but the 'distress' value is inaccessible from the kernel internals for user-space software. So this method, unfortunately, is unusable in production, and that's why it is disabled by default. You can enable it with ```-showTendency``` option.

Metrics:
```swp_tend``` - 'swap tendency' metric counted as described above.


### cgroups eventfd observer
This sets up cgroups 'memory_pressure' event file descriptor and subscribes for these events. CGroups subsystem allows us to set physical and virtual memory limits for the process or process group. "Memory pressure" eval is based on "scanned/reclaimed pages" ratio, see Linux kernel comments for details:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/mm/vmpressure.c?id=34e431b0ae398fc54ea69ff85ec700722c9da773

```/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/cgroup.event_control``` is used to subscribe for events from ```/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/memory.pressure_level``` - this is a standard cgroups mechanism.

Metric from this observer:
```cgroups``` - bit mask ('critical - 'medium' - 'low'). E.g., in case of 'low' trigger, the value will be 1, in case of all triggers active, the value will be equal to 7.

This observer may require superuser rights to initialize and run.

### PSI (pressure stall information) observer
PSI aggregates and reports the overall wallclock time in which the
tasks in a system wait for contended hardware resources. In modern Linux kernels, ```/proc/pressure/memory``` file provides information on the time that processes spend waiting due to memory pressure.

The metics are:

```psi_some``` - the percentage of the time that at least one process could be running if it weren't waiting for memory resources

```psi_full``` - the percentage of time that nobody is able to use the CPU for actual work due to memory pressure

By default, ```avg10``` (10 seconds averaged) values are used. You can override it using custom option, e.g.  ```-psiAvgMetric="avg60"```

### PSI (pressure stall information) _triggers_ observer
This sets up PSI 2 event file descriptors and subscribes for the triggers. A trigger describes the maximum cumulative stall time over a specific time window, e.g. 100ms of total stall time within any 500ms window to generate a wakeup event. Triggers are fired when resource pressure exceeds certain thresholds. Please refer to Linux kernel documentation for details:
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/accounting/psi.html#monitoring-for-pressure-thresholds


Metric from this observer:
```psi_trig``` - bit mask ('critical - 'medium'). E.g., in case of 'medium' trigger, the value will be 1, in case of both triggers fired, the value will be equal to 3.

This observer may require superuser rights to initialize and run.

Default triggers thresholds settings are ```some 150000 1000000``` and ```full 100000 1000000```, but you can override it using options: ```-psiMediumTrigger="some 200000 1000000" -psiCriticalTrigger="some 300000 1000000"```

And one more option is a trigger timeout (in seconds) and it is related to time windows value from thresholds settings. If the trigger doesn't fire again during the timeout, the bitmask for this trigger is set back to 0. Default value is 5 seconds, you can override it: ```-psiTrigTimeout=2```


### Allocator
Allocator is used for allocating (^_^) new memory block every second. Because 'overcommit memory' feature is enabled by default on modern Linux systems, allocator also fills one byte in every memory page with a random value to force the system memory allocator to allocate the memory page (TODO: rewrite this paragraph in a human-readable style :) )

The default block size is 128 megabytes, it can also be specified as a command-line argument.

In case if 'block size' value is set to 0, 'memory-pressure' binary will not initialize and start the allocator module at all and will work simply in passive mode.

Also it is possible to pre-allocate some block with a specified size before the test, and set the maximum limit of allocated memory, and the test will stop after reaching it.

```
Command line arguments:
  -allocInterval int
    	time delay between allocations (in seconds) (default 1)
  -blockSize int
    	block size for every allocation (in Mb), 0 to disable periodical allocator (default 128)
  -initialSize int
    	size to allocate before test start (in Mb), 0 to disable initial allocation
  -limit int
    	maximum allocated memory size (in Mb), 0 to disable the limit
```

Allocator reports total allocated memory blocks size to ```'alloctd'``` metric.


### Tracker
It collects all the metrics from the sub-components and prints to the stdout every N (default N=5, right) seconds or in case of events. It shows adds the time from the process start (in seconds) in the ```'time'``` metric.

```
Command line argument:
  -printInterval int
    	time delay between current status updates (in seconds) (default 5)
```

## How to run and test
```git clone```, ```go build``` and run!

And, of course, ```go test``` if you need this.
